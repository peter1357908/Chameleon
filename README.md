# Targeted-IPD-Agent
Final project for ECO 386E Introduction to Game Theory, where I present an evolutionary IPD strategy called Chameleon, that attempts to exploit other group strategies through mimicry.

The primary contribution are as follows:

0. a simple Evolutionary IPD simulation framework (as opposed to the comprehensive Axelrod module)
1. show the existence of an overfit strategy in an evolutionary setting (confirm that it works as expected)
2. show that it can defeat other group strategies without being an inherent group strategy itself
3. explore whether it is robust in noisy environments (e.g., communication error at 5% probability). 

# Original Inspiration

The Evolution of Trust by Nicky Case, available here: https://ncase.me/trust/

After that, many IPD papers. Details will be available in the final report.
